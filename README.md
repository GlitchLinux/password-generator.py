# Password Generator

`password-generator.py` is a Python script designed to generate highly secure and complex passwords by combining random letters, symbols, and numbers. Using a mix of cryptographic-grade randomness and varied character sets, it provides strong passwords ideal for safeguarding sensitive accounts and applications.

## Features

- **Multi-part Password Structure**: Each password consists of four randomized segments, containing letters, symbols, and numbers in each part to maximize security.
- **Customizable Password Count**: Specify how many passwords you need, and the script will generate unique options for you.
- **Enhanced Security**: Uses Python’s `secrets` library to ensure cryptographic randomness, providing maximum entropy for password generation.
